This is a brief example of how to use the `readdst` package to import all analyses and data from an existing [Distance for Windows](http://distancesampling.org/Distance) project.

## Preliminaries

I assume here that you have a Distance for Windows project file (in this case we're going to try out the "Golf Tees" example, which is shipped with Distance for Windows). This consists of a file called `project.dst` and a folder named `Golftees.dat`. The folder can contain numerous other files (including R analyses, shapefiles, plots etc) but we'll ignore everything apart from the `DistData.mdb` file that contains the data used to fit our models.

To read the Access database files (the `.dst` file and `DistData.mdb` you need to have the `Hmisc` package installed and a copy of [`mdb-tools`](http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net/) installed on your computer. On Mac, if you have [`homebrew`](http://brew.sh/) installed, this consists of simply running `brew install mdb-tools`.

# General principle

`readdst` looks in the project `.dst` file, extracts the analyses, generates the correct calls to `ddf` and then runs those analyses, using the data it extracted from `DistData.mdb`. The various tables in the Distance for Windows databases relate in the following ways (source: Distance Developer's manual):

Although all of this is going on in the background, there are only a few functions one actually has to worry about.


# Golf tees

We begin by finding the golf tees project on our computer, since this project is shipped with `readdst` we can use `system.file` to find the path to it:

```{r}
res.filename<-system.file("Golftees-example", package="readdst")
```
