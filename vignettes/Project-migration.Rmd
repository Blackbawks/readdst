# Migration of DistWin analysis structure to R

The Windows-based GUI software for conducting distance sampling analysis (*Distance for Windows*, heretofore *DistWin*) has been the industry-standard for two decades.  Our development work continues to incorporate state-of-the-art analytical methods for software users.  Most of that software development takes place in the `R` language.

As a portal for statisticans and biologists who have existing `DistWin` projects, the `readdst` package was created.  It was originally intended as an *in-house* testing tool to enable comparison of analysis results of newly-developed analysis software, with results produced by `Distwin`. The purpose of the package is to convert data and analyses stored in `DistWin` projects into data objects and function calls for analysis using `R`.

This vignette is intended to give a few examples of the capabilities of `readdst`.  Readers of this vignette should have some familiarity with the organisation of `DistWin` projects along with functions in the `mrds` library for fitting detection functions.

# Structure of `DistWin` project

`DistWin` projects carry not only the data collected in the field, but also survey descriptions, data filters, model definitions and analysis results.

* Survey information includes point or line transect types, whether animals were recorded as individuals or clusters, whether perpendicular distances or radial distances and angles were recorded.
* Data filters possess information about sightings to include in analysis (truncation distance, species indicators for multi-species surveys)
* Model definitions describe the key function and adjustment term combinations to be fitted as the detection function, whether data will be combined across strata for detection function fitting, etc.
